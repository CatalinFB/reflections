Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
-When you pull changes manually you can choose what is important to sync and what is not.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
-Forks copyes a repository made avilable by someone else so that you can add modifications to it. Clones download a repository in your own computer.
Branches are a "side" leg of the code where you can try new features or test a new version.
